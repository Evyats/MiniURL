open in each vscode one repo at a time - opened on the correct interpreter and venv.

docker versions - prefer always locking the version.


use db credentials always: MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME / PASSWORD

never git a database - always git ignore it.

db client - create only when needed (get function for each part).

use env vars for: ttl, db credentials, db name, other services ips, env flags.


create async functions for all fastapi routes.

add validations to any user input to avoid injections.

use env vars for the ips in the frontend too.

avoid the frontend to do backend stuff such as building the short url - this should be done and returned by the backend.

input validation in frontend should be thorough to avoid unnecessary requests to the backend.

wrap every micro service inside a docker container.

make a use of logging - to track info and errors.
