open in each vscode one repo at a time - opened on the correct interpreter and venv.

docker versions - prefer always locking the version.

use db credentials always: MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME / PASSWORD

never git a database - always git ignore it.

db client - create only when needed (get function for each part).

use env vars for: ttl, db credentials, db name, other services ips, env flags.

create async functions for all fastapi routes.

add validations to any user input to avoid injections.

use env vars for the ips in the frontend too.

avoid the frontend to do backend stuff such as building the short url - this should be done and returned by the backend.

input validation in frontend should be thorough to avoid unnecessary requests to the backend.

wrap every micro service inside a docker container.

make a use of logging - to track info and errors.

python private functions - always start with underscore '_'

all python code - inside an app folder, not in the root

config: env file for the vars definitions and values, config.py for the code that reads them and makes them available to the app.

fastapi: add a function for the startup actions such as indexing the db, and shutdown such as closing the db connection.

have a separation between backend naming conventions and frontend objects that consume the backend api.

frontend: have a file for handling all api calls to the backend, splitted to functions.
